#### Automated Driving   
- Next generation of shared autonomous vehicles (SAVs).  
**Chen, K.-T.**, Donahue, M., Paquet, V.  
To Understand detailed needs of people with disabilities and older adults using shared autonomous vehicles, and to develop user-tested reference designs.  

- A framework for understanding where failures may occur in highly automated driving.  
**Chen, K.-T.**, Sahin, E., Shen, S., Bisantz, A., & Chen, H.-Y.W.  
To provide a complementary perspective to existing works on taxonomies for takeover situations that emphasize both the partnership of human and automation (serving as lead or backup to each other) and the combinations of conditions within the operational design domain.

- A study of the effectiveness of sonification feedback for highly automated driving.  
**Chen, K.-T.**, Chen, H.-Y.W.  
Design blended sonification based countinuous feedback system to support driver awareness of system reliability while engaging in non-driving related tasks in SAE level 3 automated driving.

#### Driving Styles  
- Using naturalistic driving data to examine the influences of driving syltes on crash severity level.  
**Chen, K.-T.**, Chen, H.-Y.W. 
    - *Phase 1.* Identifying driver driving styles   
    The study aimed at identifying driver drivng styles based on vehicle kinematics without prior assumption of what drivng style is.

    - *Phase 2.* Driving styles and crash severity level.  
    Using Diagonal Inflated Bivariate Poisson (DIBP) model to study the association between driving styles and carsh severity level.

#### Intern Projects  
- Review of speed limit design and setting practice.  
Kim, W., Kelley-Baker, T. & **Chen, K.-T.**.  
Collected information of speed limit design process and analyzed survey from practitioners to prepare research brief for the impact of speed limit change on traffic safety.  
[`[Resesarch brief]`](https://aaafoundation.org/review-of-current-practice-for-setting-posted-speed-limits/)  

- Using FARS data to study Hit-and-Run.  
Benson, A., Villavicencio, L., Horrey, W.J. & **Chen, K.-T.**  
Performed Fatality Analysis Reporting System (FARS) data wrangling with R for Hit-and-Run study.  

- Systematic review of oral fluid detection window.  
Arnold, L.S., Benson, A., **Chen, K.-T.**, Kelley-Baker, T. & Horrey, W.J.  
Conducted systematic review regarding detection time of drug usage with oral fluid.

#### Other Previous Projects  
*Railway Operation and Management*
- Development of timetable stability and effieicney evaluation model.  
Lai, Y.-C, **Chen, K.-T.**  
This research proposed an analytic framework to evaluate timetable stability based on our proposed index “recovery time”. A monte carlo simulation method was proposed to further consider railway operation uncertainty.
