#### Automated Driving  
- Supporting the development of Autonomous Relay Convoy truck fleets development.  
_Affiliation:_ Locomation, Inc.  
Role: Human Factors Engineer  
Conduct task analyses, operator errors identification to identify human-machine interface design requirements to support driver situation awareness of automated following truck. 
- Next generation of shared autonomous vehicles (SAVs).  
_Affiliation:_ University at Buffalo  
Role: Graduate Research Assistant  
**Chen, K.-T.**, Donahue, M., Paquet, V.  
To Understand detailed needs of people with disabilities and older adults using shared autonomous vehicles, and to develop user-tested reference designs.  

- A framework for understanding where failures may occur in highly automated driving.  
_Affiliation:_ University at Buffalo  
Role: Graduate Research Assistant    
**Chen, K.-T.**, Sahin, E., Shen, S., Bisantz, A., & Chen, H.-Y.W.  
To provide a complementary perspective to existing works on taxonomies for takeover situations that emphasize both the partnership of human and automation (serving as lead or backup to each other) and the combinations of conditions within the operational design domain.

- A study of the effectiveness of sonification feedback for highly automated driving.  
_Affiliation:_ University at Buffalo  
Role: Graduate Research Assistant   
**Chen, K.-T.**, Chen, H.-Y.W.  
Design blended sonification based countinuous feedback system to support driver awareness of system reliability while engaging in non-driving related tasks in SAE level 3 automated driving.

#### Driving Styles  
- Using naturalistic driving data to examine the influences of driving syltes on crash severity level.  
_Affiliation:_ University at Buffalo  
Role: Graduate Research Assistant  
**Chen, K.-T.**, Chen, H.-Y.W. 
    - *Phase 1.* Identifying driver driving styles   
    The study aimed at identifying driver drivng styles based on vehicle kinematics without prior assumption of what drivng style is.

    - *Phase 2.* Driving styles and crash severity level.  
    Using Diagonal Inflated Bivariate Poisson (DIBP) model to study the association between driving styles and carsh severity level.

#### Intern Projects  
_Affiliation:_ AAA Foundation for Traffic Safety  
Role: Summer Intern  
- Review of speed limit design and setting practice.  
Kim, W., Kelley-Baker, T. & **Chen, K.-T.**.  
Collected information of speed limit design process and analyzed survey from practitioners to prepare research brief for the impact of speed limit change on traffic safety.  
[`[Resesarch brief]`](https://aaafoundation.org/review-of-current-practice-for-setting-posted-speed-limits/)  

- Using FARS data to study Hit-and-Run. 
Benson, A., Villavicencio, L., Horrey, W.J. & **Chen, K.-T.**  
Performed Fatality Analysis Reporting System (FARS) data wrangling with R for Hit-and-Run study.  

- Systematic review of oral fluid detection window. 
Arnold, L.S., Benson, A., **Chen, K.-T.**, Kelley-Baker, T. & Horrey, W.J.  
Conducted systematic review regarding detection time of drug usage with oral fluid.

#### Other Previous Projects  
*Railway Operation and Management*
- Development of timetable stability and effieicney evaluation model.  
_Affiliation:_ National Taiwan University  
Role: Graduate Resesarch Assistant  
Lai, Y.-C, **Chen, K.-T.**  
This research proposed an analytic framework to evaluate timetable stability based on our proposed index “recovery time”. A monte carlo simulation method was proposed to further consider railway operation uncertainty.

[`[Paper 2]`](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0361198118790325)

*High-Temperature Gas Cooled Small Modular Reactor Nuclear Power Plant*
- Reactor control room human-machine interface development.  
_Affiliation:_ X-energy, LLC  
Role: Human-Machine Interface Engineer  
Coordinated human factors activities following nuclear standards (Mainly NUREG-0711), tasks included function allocation and identify important human actions.
